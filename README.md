<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is my porfolio site that I created using Gastby. Hope you like it. Must use yarn. Avoid npm please.


* Gatsby is a static site generator.
* Fast, Safe and secure.
*  Built with i18n.
*  :smile:



### Built With

* Gatsby
* Bootstrap
* Google analytics
* SASS
* Font-Awesome





### Installation


1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lalebdi/myNewPortfolio.git
```
2. Install packages
```sh
yarn install
```


<!-- Configuration -->
## Configuration
* All contents can be configured in the markdown files in the content directory.
* The Analytics settings are in the site.js file in the config directory.
* The app's main title can be changed in the top-index.jsx in the src/templates directory.
* There are commented out sections that you can use in case you want to add them such as Services, Clients and testimonials. You can unhide these components in the index.js in the src/views/sections directory.
* The facebook tag in the Footer md files is not the facebook logo. It is a misnomer I used so you can link your resume for viewing and downloading. (don't put your facebook there).
